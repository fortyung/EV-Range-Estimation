# EV-Range-Estimation
MatLab Project on EV Range Estimation

Electric vehicle (EV) range estimation is crucial for evaluating performance and
usability. This report focuses on analyzing the range of EVs using MATLAB simulations
for specific drive cycles. Key factors such as battery pack configurations, vehicle
dynamics, and energy consumption are considered. Standard drive cycles—UDDS for
urban driving and US06 for highways—are used to compute duty cycles, battery current,
and state of charge (SOC). The study provides insights into range estimation, aiding in
the design and optimization of EV systems for real-world applications.
